# Study Notes Summarizer & Quiz Generator Agent

This project develops a multi-functional agent designed to assist students and professionals in managing their study materials. It can extract text from PDFs, summarize content using the Gemini AI model, store all relevant data in an SQLite database, and generate interactive quizzes, all presented through a highly polished and interactive Streamlit user interface.

## Core Features

### 1. PDF Summarizer
- **PDF Upload:** Users can upload PDF documents via the Streamlit UI.
- **Text Extraction:** Utilizes `pypdf` to extract text from all pages of the uploaded PDF.
- **AI-Powered Summarization:** Leverages the Gemini 2.5 Flash model to generate clean, structured, and meaningful summaries. Summaries focus on key concepts, examples, and important details, presented with headings, bullet points, or numbered lists.
- **Persistent Storage:** PDF metadata, extracted text, and generated summaries are stored in an SQLite database.
- **Modern UI Display:** Summaries are displayed using stylish Streamlit components, including cards with shadows, rounded edges, expanders for details, and colored headers.

### 2. Quiz Generator
- **Interactive Quiz Generation:** After summary generation, users can create quizzes based on the original PDF text.
- **Question Types:** Generates 10+ Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and 5-10 mixed questions (True/False, Fill-in-the-Blank).
- **Quiz Storage:** Quizzes are saved as JSON objects in the SQLite database.
- **Engaging UI:** Questions are displayed in an interactive and stylish Streamlit UI with cards, columns for options, and progress bars.
- **Answer Checking & Scoring:** Includes a "Check Answers" button to evaluate responses, display scores with color-coded results, and save quiz attempts to SQLite.

## Technology Stack

- **AI Model:** Gemini 2.5 Flash (via Gemini CLI)
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python framework for interactive web apps)
- **Database:** SQLite (for persistent data storage)
- **PDF Processing:** PyPDF / pypdf
- **Environment Management:** `python-dotenv` for managing environment variables.

## Project Structure (Anticipated)

- `main.py`: Main Streamlit application entry point and UI logic.
- `agent.py`: Contains the core logic for PDF processing, Gemini integration, and quiz generation.
- `database.py`: Handles all SQLite database interactions (schema creation, data insertion, retrieval).
- `GEMINI.md`: Provides persistent context and instructions for the Gemini CLI.
- `.env`: Stores sensitive information like API keys.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # On Windows:
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Note: `requirements.txt` will contain `streamlit`, `pypdf`, `python-dotenv` and potentially others.)

4.  **Set up Gemini API Key:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your Gemini API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Gemini API key.

5.  **Database Initialization:**
    The SQLite database (`study_agent.db`) and its tables (`pdf_files`, `summaries`, `quizzes`, `quiz_attempts`) will be automatically created upon the first run if they do not exist.

## How to Run

After completing the setup, run the Streamlit application using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This will open the application in your default web browser.

## Workflow

The agent provides a full end-to-end stylish workflow:
1.  **Upload:** Upload a PDF document.
2.  **Extract:** Text is extracted from the PDF.
3.  **Summarize:** A comprehensive summary is generated by Gemini.
4.  **Quiz:** Interactive quizzes are generated based on the PDF content.
5.  **Store:** All data (PDFs, summaries, quizzes, user attempts) are persistently stored in SQLite.
6.  **Evaluate:** User quiz attempts are evaluated, and scores are displayed.

Enjoy a seamless and intelligent study experience!
